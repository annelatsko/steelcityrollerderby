Steel City Roller Derby - Documentation for a better tomorrow

### Overview

In a further effort to make sure that all processes are easy to understand and accessible to everyone, they are going to be documented here, in this public Github repo. Anne Latsko (Wolverkween) is the owner at this point in time for ease of changes. This repo will be swapped to the official [SCRD github account](https://github.com/steelcityrollerderby) once it's set up.

### How to contribute

1. Contact Wolverkween via Slack or email (anne.latsko@gmail.com) to get the password for the [SCRD github account](https://github.com/steelcityrollerderby).
